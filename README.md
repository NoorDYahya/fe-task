# React + Vite



Project Overview
Fetch Pokémon Data + Components:
At the beginning, I started fetching data from the API using standard fetch requests and building the main components such as the Pokémon card and list card. I utilized React Router for mapping the web pages to enable navigation within the application.

State Management:
Initially, I managed state using localStorage and useState hooks. However, to facilitate real-time updates and avoid the need for refreshing the page to see changes, I transitioned to using Redux. This allowed for more efficient state management and improved user experience.

Styling:
For styling, I began with CSS and decided to continue using it without incorporating any other libraries like Bootstrap, even though I am familiar with them. This choice was made to maintain consistency and simplicity in the styling approach throughout the project.
